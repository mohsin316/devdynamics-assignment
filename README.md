## My process

I built this with the help of react, typescript and chartJs. The website is split into 2 pages, The home page and the employee detail page. The home page shows the employees and some basic information. the employee detail page shows each specific employees details in the form of a dashboard.

The dashboard uses 1 week worth of data. It displays the daily and weekly activities of the employee. The data is also compared to the previous day or the previous week.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
